## Front-End - Single Page Application (Recomendend)
### HTML5 + CSS3 + Javascript

>Modern web development techniques to build a single-page app that doesn’t need to reload itself as the user browses through it. This pattern is more of a complete restructuring of how the web works rather than something you can hack into your app afterwards.
In a way, the page in a single-page app isn’t really a page in the traditional web sense, rather it's more of a particular data view. Single-page web apps load asynchronously (using Ajax), in that they perform instantly without the user having to wait for separate pages to load between operations.

### Responsive Design
Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones)

See below the list of several frameworks for HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web

Framework | Version | Description | URL
-|-|-|
Bootstrap | 3.x or higher | The most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. | http://getbootstrap.com
Semantic UI | 2.x or higher |  Semantic empowers designers and developers by creating a shared vocabulary for UI. | http://semantic-ui.com
Material Design | none |  We’re Google Design, a cooperative effort led by a group of designers, developers, writers, and UX advocates at Google whose goal is to capture and share our work and ideas with you. | https://design.google.com/
Zurb Foundation | 6 or higher | css3 and html5 | zurb.foundation.org

###### CSS Preprocessor
Utilizar pre-processadores de css como SASS ou LESS.

### Javascript

> InfoQ - (The Modern JavaScript Developer’s Toolbox)

> The Web Platform has gone a long way since HTML5 was first made popular and people started looking into JavaScript as a language that could do build complex apps. Many APIs have emerged and there is an abundance of content out there about how the browser can leverage all this.
>
This specific article series will go a step further and focus on how these powerful technologies can be leveraged in practise, not to building cool demos and prototypes, but how real practitioners use them in the trenches. In this (post)HTML5 series, we'll go beyond buzzwords and get practical insight from experts about what has actually worked for them. We'll also talk about technologies (like AngularJS) that go a step further, and define the future of how the standards and web development will evolve.

JavaScript is a scripting language initially designed to enhance web pages, but is now used in almost every way imaginable. Advances have been made that allow JavaScript to **run on the server-side** as well as be compiled into native phone application code. Today’s JavaScript developer is part of a rich ecosystem filled with hundreds of IDEs, tools, and frameworks. With so many options and resources, some developers may find it difficult to know where to begin. I’d like to discuss and profile the modern JavaScript developer, beginning with a brief history of JavaScript and then covering the most popular frameworks, tools, and IDEs.

Today, JavaScript can be found virtually everywhere. From AJAX, to Bootstrap, to ReactJS, Angular, the ubiquitous jQuery, and even Node.js on the server side, JavaScript has become one of the most important and popular web languages.

Frameworks

One of the biggest ways JavaScript has changed since its inception is in its use. Gone are the days of awkward document.GetElementById calls and cumbersome XmlHttpRequest objects. Instead, helpful libraries have abstracted much of the root functionality making JavaScript more accessible to developers. This is a big part of why you see JavaScript everywhere.
